# Example trace file for GNRS client.
# 
# Each line represents a message that will be sent to the GNRS server by the
# client.  Depending on the operation involved, different lines will have
# different numbers of parameters.
# 
# Insert a number of GUID -> Network Address bindings.  These will serve as
# examples for inserting, but also as values to look-up later in the trace.
#
# Format
# <Seq. No.> I <GUID> <Network Address>,<TTL>,<Weight>
#
# * Seq. No. - Unique identifier for the message.
# * I - Insert message. Always "I"
# * GUID - GUID value to insert/bind
# * Network Address - Bound value for the GUID
# * TTL - Maximum lifetime of binding (in milliseconds)
# * Weight - Undefined value for prioritizing bindings

1 I 1 1,99999,1 # Comments may also be placed at the ends of lines.
2 I 2 2,99999,1 # Anything after a "#" will be ignored by the client.
3 I 3 3,99999,1,19,88888,2 # This line has a second binding
4 I 4 4,99999,1
5 I 5 5,99999,1
6 I 6 6,99999,1
7 I 7 7,99999,1
8 I 8 8,99999,1
9 I 9 9,99999,1

# Query a GUID binding from the server. These serve as example of both
# successful and unsuccessful lookups.  A lookup failure can occur for many
# reasons, but the client should at least try to emulate those failures that
# it can (missing GUID, expired bindings, etc.)
#
# Format
# <Seq. No.> Q <GUID>
#
# * Seq. No. - Unique identifier for the message. Common to continue from
#              above (or at least not collide).
# * Q - Query message. Always "Q"
# * GUID - The GUID value to query
#
# The following queries should succeed, assuming that the insertions above
# also succeeded.
