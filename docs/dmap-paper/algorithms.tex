	\subsection{Overview}
	In our NRS, each key is under responsibility of at least one node. Given a message contain $GUID$ to be queried, our Resolution Service routes the message to the node that is responsible for that $ GUID $. The process takes network topology and underlying routing into account to minimize latency yet guarantee the scalability. 
	We proposing two different approaches tailored for different assumptions on the underlying network layer. The first approach, \textit{direct hashing}, is designed to archive aforementioned goals on scalability and latency with backward compatibility to current Internet configuration in mind. The second approach, namely \textit{Overlay hashing}, is proposed with the assumption of a \\

	General straw man design: (1) Routers will warehouse the mapping from GUID to IP address. (2)
