As more mobile devices are connected to Internet, separating host names from network addresses is becoming a key enabling technique. In this paper we discuss the design of a fast naming resolution service that can provide the mapping from a host name to its network address, thus facilitating this separation. We take a distributed approach by storing the mappings on the routers, and uses consistent hashing to find the routers that store a specific host name. As a result, our naming resolution service is scalable, fast, reliable, and compatible with current Internet architecture. Through detailed simulations with *** routers and *** names, we show that we can achieve *** ms lookup latencies.
