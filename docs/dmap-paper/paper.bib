	abstract = {This paper introduces Hidden Identity-based Signatures {(Hidden-IBS),} a type of digital signatures that provide mediated signer-anonymity on top of Shamir's Identity-based signatures. The motivation of our new signature primitive is to resolve an important issue with the kind of anonymity offered by "group signatures" where it is required that either the group membership list is public or that the opening authority is dependent on the group manager for its operation. Contrary to this, {Hidden-IBS} do not require the maintenance of a group membership list and they enable an opening authority that is totally independent of the group manager. As we argue this makes {Hidden-IBS} much more attractive than group signatures for a number of applications. In this paper, we provide a formal model of {Hidden-IBS} as well as two efficient constructions that realize the new primitive. Our elliptic curve construction that is based on the {SDH/DLDH} assumptions produces signatures that are merely 4605 bits long and can be implemented very efficiently.},

Session initiation protocol {(SIP)} is a widely discussed protocol, which is used for signaling and mobility management, especially in Voice over {IP} {(VoIP)} environment. However, its mobility management is restricted to {SIP} sessions only. To provide a full mobility management for services in future wireless {IP} networks, {SIP} can be combined with other protocols. In this paper, a new mobility management scheme based on host identity protocol {(HIP)} and {SIP} is proposed. The hybrid {SIP} and {HIP} {(SHIP)} scheme is for all services. {SHIP} has better performance in handoff signaling than {SIP.} Its signaling overhead is smaller and the signaling delay is much shorter. {SHIP} has been shown to outperform hybrid {SIP} and mobile {IP,} a widely discussed mobility management scheme, in a number of areas.},

While the existing Internet mobility standards, namely Mobile {IP,} is waiting for a wide adoption, cellphone networks are providing the ubiquitous mobility services on a global scale as of today. They have also promoted {IP} core network architecture and adopted Proxy Mobile {IPv6,} an extension to Mobile {IP,} for their mobility service. There is an open question regarding whether the Internet would, or would not, require significant architectural changes to provide universal mobility support at a scale that is likely to go far beyond the scale and scope of today's cellular telephone services. In this paper, we examine the fundamental di erences between the mobility service models provided by Internet and cellphone systems. We argue that decoupling network access control from mobility support can provide an architecturally promising direction for scalable and decentralized mobile communications, and that designing mobility support outside the global routing system can o er an overall best tradeo as measured by flexibility, manageability, and scalability of the resulting systems.},

Not all of the problem is due to the small {IPv4} address space and resulting {NAT} boxes. Even where global addresses exist, firewalls cannot glean enough information about a flow from packet headers, and so often err, typically by being over-conservative: disallowing flows that might otherwise be allowed. This paper presents a novel architecture, protocol design, and implementation, for flow establishment in the Internet. The architecture, called {NUTSS,} takes into account the combined policies of endpoints and network providers. While {NUTSS} borrows liberally from other proposals {(URI-like} naming, signaling to manage ephemeral {IPv4} or {IPv6} data flows), {NUTSS} is unique in that it couples overlay signaling with data-path signaling. {NUTSS} requires no changes to existing protocol stacks, and combined with recent {NAT} traversal techniques, works with {IPv4} and existing {NAT/firewalls.} This paper describes {NUTSS} and shows how it satisfies a wide range of "end-middle-end"network requirements, including access control, middlebox steering, multi-homing, mobility, and protocol negotiation.},

	abstract = {Internet architecture is facing at least three major challenges. First, it is running out of {IPv4} addresses. {IPv6} offers a long-term solution to the problem by offering a vast amount of addresses but is neither supported widely by networking software nor has been deployed widely in different networks. Second, end-to-end connectivity is broken by the introduction of {NATs,} originally invented to circumvent the address depletion. Third, the Internet architecture lacks a mechanism that supports end-host mobility and multihoming in a coherent way between {IPv4} and {IPv6} networks. We argue that an identifier-locator split can solve these three problems based on our experimentation with the host identity protocol. The split separates upper layer identifiers from lower network layer identifiers, thus enabling network-location and {IP-version} independent applications. Our contribution consists of recommendations to the present {HIP} standards to utilize cross-family mobility more efficiently based on our implementation experiences. To the best of our knowledge we are also the first ones to show a performance evaluation of {HIP-based} cross-family handovers.},

Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct.

Our position is grounded on the intuition that mobile devices that users carry can act as "powerful" sensors for diverse information about a specific location, and can aid in providing real-time updates to other interested users that are not present at the location. Realizing such services is, however, challenging due to the need for several mechanisms such as (a) incentives for participation from users and network providers, (b) location-specific data collection and delivery and (c) determining trust in users providing updates. These mechanisms become significantly more complex to realize with user mobility. Unifying these mechanisms, in this paper, we propose a framework {FLORA} that enables rapid evolution of location specific real-time services.},

	abstract = {In this note, we propose a security mechanism for protecting {IPv6} networks from possible abuses caused by the malicious usage of a multihoming protocol. In the presented approach, each multihomed node is assigned multiple prefixes from its upstream providers, and it creates the interface identifier part of its addresses by incorporating a cryptographic one-way hash of the available prefix set. The result is that the addresses of each multihomed node form an unalterable set of intrinsically bound {IPv6} addresses. This allows any node that is communicating with the multihomed node to securely verify that all the alternative addresses proposed through the multihoming protocol are associated to the address used for establishing the communication. The verification process is extremely efficient because it only involves hash operations.},

In this paper, we propose a lightweight (fast) secure routing protocol, Secure Proactive Tree-based Routing {(SPTR)} to hit these two points. {SPTR} makes use of the characteristics of {VANET} networks, that is, the traffic originates from or terminates at the gateway or road side unit. {SPRT} also takes advantages of certificate-less {ID-based} cryptography to provide message authentication. Analysis and simulations show that {SPTR} has low routing discovery delay and communication overhead in highly mobile large-scale {VANET} even if authenticating routing messages.},

One consequence of these goals is that these services leak some information about the network latency between the sender and one or more nodes in the system. We present two attacks on low-latency anonymity schemes using this information. The first attack allows a pair of colluding Web sites to predict, based on local timing information and with no additional resources, whether two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit with high confidence. The second attack requires more resources but allows a malicious Web site to gain several bits of information about a client each time he visits the site. We evaluate both attacks against two low-latency anonymity protocols—the Tor network and the {MultiProxy} proxy aggregator service—and conclude that both are highly vulnerable to these attacks.},

The first technique, Geo Track, infers location based on the {DNS} names of the target host or other nearby network nodes. The second technique, {GeoPing,} uses network delay measurements from geographically distributed locations to deduce the coordinates of the target host. The third technique, {GeoCluster,} combines partial (and possibly inaccurate) host-to-location mapping information and {BGP} prefix information to infer the location of the target host. Using extensive and varied data sets, we evaluate the performance of these techniques and identify fundamental challenges in deducing geographic location from the {IP} address of an Internet host.},

Our design integrates a context aware handoff system that triggers the dynamic switching of the {HIP} host identity binding between a private address managed by a mobile router and a topologically correct address, in order to simultaneously take advantage of the efficient handover offered by vehicular networks with {NEMO} support, and the infrastructure-less operability of {HIP} when mobile routers become unavailable.

This makes it hard to support the need for multi-homing, traffic engineering, and mobility while maintaining address hierarchy that is essential for scalable routing. Thus, there is a need to separate identifiers from locators. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to this separation and define an architecture that exploits this separation to achieve routing scalability. While most of current proposals to {ID-address} separation are focused on solving the multi-homing and traffic engineering problems for commercial Internet, we develop a solution that addresses these two problems as well as the need to support network mobility which is more important for the {GIG} tactical domains. Besides scalability, our protocol solution (address-identifier mapping system - {AIMS)} provides rapid response to mobility by making {IDs} flat and portable while keeping addressing hierarchical and dynamic.},

To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes a general, overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows i3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.},

Such a service would enable a large and interesting class of location-aware applications. This is a challenging problem because an {IP} address does not inherently contain an indication of {location.We} present and evaluate three distinct techniques, collectively referred to as {IP2Geo,} for determining the geographic location of Internet hosts. The first technique, Geo Track, infers location based on the {DNS} names of the target host or other nearby network nodes. The second technique, {GeoPing,} uses network delay measurements from geographically distributed locations to deduce the coordinates of the target host. The third technique, {GeoCluster,} combines partial (and possibly inaccurate) host-to-location mapping information and {BGP} prefix information to infer the location of the target host. Using extensive and varied data sets, we evaluate the performance of these techniques and identify fundamental challenges in deducing geographic location from the {IP} address of an Internet host.},

In order to hide the communication of users, many anonymity systems pack the application data into equal-sized cells (e.g., 512 bytes for Tor, a known real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication network). In this paper, we investigate a new cell counter based attack against Tor, which allows the attacker to confirm anonymous communication relationship among users very quickly. In this attack, by marginally varying the counter of cells in the target traffic at the malicious exit onion router, the attacker can embed a secret signal into the variation of cell counter of the target traffic. The embedded signal will be carried along with the target traffic and arrive at the malicious entry onion router. Then an accomplice of the attacker at the malicious entry onion router will detect the embedded signal based on the received cells and confirm the communication relationship among users. We have implemented this attack against Tor and our experimental data validate its feasibility and effectiveness. There are several unique features of this attack. First, this attack is highly efficient and can confirm very short communication sessions with only tens of cells. Second, this attack is effective and its detection rate approaches 100\% with a very low false positive rate. Third, it is possible to implement the attack in a way that appears to be very difficult for honest participants to detect (e.g. using our hopping-based signal embedding).},

Using 266 {MHz} Pentium {II-based} laptops, our {HIP} implementation took slightly under 1 second on average to complete connection setup, and less than 200 ms to process a mobility-initiated readdress.

Many networks use, for example, {MAC} address or {IP} address based authentication, despite of their limited security properties. These authentication systems hinder the possibility to use e.g. pseurandom {MAC} addresses for privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a privacy management system for layers below the transport layer in the {IP} stack. Our implementation allows the users to decide their privacy parameters depending on their current situation. The implementation uses the Host Identity Protocol to provide authenticated and secure seamless handovers for mobile nodes. The approach is also applicable to an {IP} stack without the Host Identity Protocol.},

But the capability of the architecture for intra domain route optimization is impaired. So we propose functionality in domain nodes to enable intra domain path optimization for ubiquitous network. It is shown that intra domain cost effect is beneficial in every hierarchical domain that spans mesh network topology. We address the key function for our proposed scheme and analyze the usefulness of our proposed method using mathematically.

Since physical address has routing significance only within a domain, it can be a private address and therefore, does not deplete the public {IP} address resource. (2) New {DHCP} enhancements to distribute the two addresses. (3) A new signaling element called Mobility Manager {(MM)} that uses Middlebox Communication {(MIDCOM)} framework to signal the changes in packet processing rules to the Network Address Translators {(NATs)} in the event of node mobility. Our proposal does not require any modifications to the access networks and can seamlessly co-exist with the existing Mobile {IP} mechanisms and therefore, can be used to provide seamless mobility across heterogeneous wireline and wireless networks.
